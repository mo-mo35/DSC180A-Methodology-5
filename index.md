## 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

I think the most interesting thing we covered in the domain this quarter are the variety of ways you can combine 
different observations in order to infer a separate object of interest. 

## 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

I would like to pursure maybe more recent and robust versions of the model that we plan to use. I'm not 100% familiar
but I think it would be cool to use the most recent developments to create something new. 

## 3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

I think I would probably try to learn things in a different order. A lot of the time I found myself caught up in
specifics of a model but there was an easier to understand and more general case just a little bit ahead. 

## 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I would be interested in maybe recreating our project at the end and seeing if the comparisons and results we get are
any different, and by how much, for brains across animal categories.
